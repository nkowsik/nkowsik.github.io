hackathon held at the
University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. Nearly 500 students participated from a variety of
universities across the US and elsewhere. Students were given 36
hours to get into teams, hack on projects, then show them off
to the judges. The results were astounding. In total, over
100 hacks were submitted.
