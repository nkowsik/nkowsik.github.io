He first joined the company in a sales role before he moved into a more product-focused position. Working closely with engineers, Kevin decides to pursue a career in software development himself. Instead of dropping out of his job to get formal education in the space, he takes online courses and within less than a year smashes the internal interview process. To learn what his thinking behind the change was and whic...</p>

That means the widget will load much faster and finally work well on most mobile platforms, including Android & iOS. And we won’t stop here. We’ll continue to improve the new widget in the coming months....</p>
